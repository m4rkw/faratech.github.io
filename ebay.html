          <h2>Custom PC builds</h2>
          <div class="rte featured-row__subtext">
            <p>We think personal computers should be just that - personal. Our bespoke PC building service aims to get right to the heart of what you want from a computer and to then realise that vision for you for the lowest overall cost.</p>

            <p>If you don't really know what you want that's fine too - we can ask the right questions and work with you to figure it out together. We're not pushy and we'll never try to sell you something unsuitable. If the budget you have in mind isn't realistic for what you want to achieve we'll tell you straight away, we'd rather lose a sale than have you buy something that you won't be happy with.</p>

            <p>Once we've agreed on a specification we take a 20% deposit from you and begin the build.</p>

            <p>Once your build is complete we will create a new ebay listing for the remainder of the agreed-upon price and then ship the computer to you via  fully-insured delivery courier.</p>

            <p>Our service and commitment to excellence is second to none and with many years of technology experience we can provide a quality of service that others cannot. As well as building you your dream computer we can also:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Offer security advice to keep your computer safe from viruses and malware</li>
              <li>Install and configure software for you</li>
              <li>Overclock CPUs and graphics cards for you to get the maximum possible performance without compromising system stability</li>
              <li>Implement security solutions such as endpoint security products or full-disk encryption</li>
              <li>Help develop tailored backup solutions to keep your personal data safe</li>
              <li>Install and configure Linux systems, including alongside Windows in a dual-boot configuration</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h2>Price vs cost</h2>
          <div class="rte featured-row__subtext">
            <p>We aim to provide you with a great product at the lowest overall cost.</p>
            <p>It's important to understand that cost and price are different things. The price is what a product initially sells for, the cost is its total cost over its useful service life.</p>
            <p>A quality name-brand power supply for a high-end gaming rig might have a price tag of £100.<br/>A cheap power supply with the same output rating might sell for £20.<br/>These numbers are the <i>price</i>, but the actual <i>cost</i> may be very different.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>Person A buys the name-brand unit for £100. It comes with a 10-year warranty, is very well made and runs for 10 years without any problems. The cost of this power supply is £100 over 10 years or £10/year.</p>
            <p>Person B buys a cheap no-name power supply online for £20. It runs ok for about six months but games seem a little unstable and sometimes crash for inexplicable reasons because the power output isn't anywhere near what was claimed. One day there's a little pop, a burning smell in the air and both a £100 motherboard and a £700 graphics card have been destroyed by the failing power supply. Of course the warranty claim only covers a replacement unit, not the damage to the other components. The cost of this cheap power supply is therefore £720 before the end of the first year.</p>

            <p>Clearly cheap power supplies cost too much. We don't skimp on quality, our aim is always to provide you with the lowest overall cost.</p>
